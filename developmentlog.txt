Previous Week's Objectives
---------------------

* [Completed/Can be improved] Creating a unit controller 6.0h (4.0 h)
   > Unit control working pretty good. Might need to change the way 
   >	it moves, feels rather rigid. Can smooth it for later.
   > Unit has a limited distance as to how far one can travel.
   > Jumping works correctly, just not so fluid. Also, air-jumping is
   >	possible for "special" units.
   > Issue: Keep track of distance is clunky, diagonal movement allows
   >	more distance travel, which shouldn't be.
   > This works independently from the camera, it is assumed the camera
   >	will follow the unit a certain way.
   > Also, includes idle, run, jump animations to be used when assigned
   >	If none are assigned, then it skips it
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Project a circle around a "focus" unit to show how far
 	they can move if they walked completely linear. 2.0h (2.0 h)
   > Created a couple of textures to use for the projection 
   > This will display onto the ground correctly. This is set to ignore:
   >	"Units", "Leaders" and "Terrain" specific layer maskings.
   > Scaling of projection ortho size took some trial and error to scale 
   >	correctly with the distance of 1 unit. Came to be ..
   >	new_ortho_size = unit_distance/(10.0/12.0)
   > This is any easy to use system, simply call "SetProjectorFocus", 
   >	from the "DistanceProjection" script passing a "focus" 
   >	GameObject, which sets focus internally and project accordingly.
   > Will display error if incorrect object is passed.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed/Ongoing] Communicate with Artists in person 2.0 h (3.0 h)
   > Encourage them for motivation to work on the game
   > Discuss art that will need to get done for the next
   > Ask the main following questions:
	- When is their availability
	- What is the best way to contact them
	- How much time can they put into the game
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

* [Completed] Come Up with Additional Race 2.0 h (2.0 h)
   > Find the opposing race of our human race
   > Have concept artists start to work on additional race
   > Chris Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

* [Not Completed] Document what interactable objects will be in the environment 3.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Write-up report as to how to make the world dynamic
   > No programming expected, till units are finalized in concept and code
   > Christopher Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

* [Partially Completed/Needs Improving] Construct class hierarchy 2.0 h (2.0 h)
   > Create base class to inherit from, also provide virtual future to unify objects 
   > Create basic class for each unit, think of individual traits for each unit
   > Mark Martene

* [Completed] Comb through a simulated round of the game to come up with questions about the game design 2.5h (5.0h)
  > Discovered problem with tiles and attacking
  > Finalized minor details of the gameplay
  > Discussed UI elements and placement
  > Discussed input devices
  > Discussed what specifically happens/can happen during a turn
  > Mark Martene

* [Not Completed]Construct an easy to use camera pane system 4.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Be able to move the camera when moving cursor to edge of the screen thus moving the camera, in their respectful direction.
   > Allow, mouse to focus on ÔvalidÕ units, thus lock the camera towards that unit and reach only to its valid movement spaces.
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

* [Trashed] Devise a method for creating tile for the map 6.0 h (5.0h)
   > Did not meet the desire for our gameplay and tiles caused too 
   >	much restrictions with the desired "feel" for our units.
   > Finalize idea of manual place(static and easy) vs 
   >	projection(dynamic and not-so-easy)
   > Implement idea, look up resource for improvement and data 
   >	structure design
   > Created appropriate tile placement and find a good ratio for the 
   >	tiles to be placed in world space.
   > Ignore objects with tag "Obstruction" to avoid placing a valid 
   >	tile on the map.
   > Christopher Randin and Ivan Espinosa

   > Acquired a desired game mode, i.e. versus, with multiple ways of winning.
	- Acquire an X amount of resources
	- Kill opponentÕs leader
	- Capture and hold X number of resource points for a Y amount of turns
   > Discussed the current groups priorities for this game
	- Submission as a final project

* Submission for this years, 2014, GameSig competition 
   > Discussed likes and dislike from other games. Presenting ideas we would like to incorporate into our game to give it uniqueness and bringing in fun mechanics from other games and/or modify with our own twist.
   > Artist presented concept art for the units we desired of the 6 units(Braver, Scout, Vanguard, Arcane, Titan, Sniper). Went over discussion on what their roles were as individuals.
   > Discussed what we wanted in the game for demo purposes:
	- 2 races
	- Unique mechanics to go with each race, choose leaders
	- Simple story/theme
	- Game mode: Versus
	- 1 Map(maybe 2 depending on time)
	- Dynamic environment with each unit(grapple to trees, break trees/wall)
   > Christopher Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

* [Ongoing] Setting up the start-up requirements and small features 2.0h (2.0h)
   > Waiting for more info as to how the game was going to play out
   > Though about possible improvement over square tile, idealize over tile projection(automatically constructs visual aspect of tile depending on the construction of the environment) vs. tile placement(easier, but a lot of manual work to reposition if map changes)
   > Construct basis class for hierarchical structure of unit derivation.
   > Christopher Randin and Ivan Espinosa
