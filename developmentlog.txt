* [Unfinished] Add animations 6.0 h ( 2.0 h)
  > Small complication when the models were using an outdated
  >     model for texture mapping.
  > Animations for the most part should work correctly.
  > We just need to send signals to control animation states.
  > Ivan Espinosa and Chris Randin

* [Ongoing] Discussions with Artist 3.0 h (15.0 h)  
  > Had to fix/discuss issues with the way files were being imported through Unity  
  > The character models that we were importing with rigs had no UV attached it. Turned out rigger used wrong character model file to rig  
  > The rigs are not currently refined in for the animations  
  >    They still lack controls that will allow the animators functionality to adjust the animations  
  > Ivan Espinosa, and Mark Martene
  
* [Ongoing] UI Interface Update 3.0 (3.0)  
  > Discussed with artists about new UI layout  
  > Issue with current layout was that it covers most of the screen

  > Instead of the words representing the actions, we will now have icons  
  > Those icons will represent basic actions like move, gather, etc.  
  > Ivan Espinosa

* [Ongoing] Camera Update 3.0 (3.0)
  > When character is selected we want the camera to be focus on the unit like in third person games  
  > Originally hard-coded, but calculated a way to have the camera adjust depending on the height of the character

  > This will help shape for reusability  
  > Christopher Randin  

* [Ongoing] Created a mock of base stats 2.0 h (2.0 h)  
  > Used similar range of numbers that can be found in D&D  
  > The arbitrary values will distinguish what each unit excels at  
  > This helps when completing the combat system for the game  
  > Ivan Espinosa  

* [Ongoing] Working on combat system 6.0 h (3.0 h)  
  > Working on scripts that will create delegate functions for each unit to work with

  > Ivan Espinosa  

* [Completed] Character Movement 8.0 h (10.0 h)  
  > When character gets selected a gui of buttons is displayed on the right side of the screen  
  > If the user selects the movement button, the camera will move its focus behind the unit  
  > The unit will also move until it has completed its arbitrary movement distance  
  > Working on creating a projector that will tell the user how far the character can move    
  > Ivan Espinosa  

* [On Hold] Implement abilities 10.0 h  
  > Once class hierarchy is done, inject abilities for each unit  
  > Will need to figure out how each unit will be allow to do specific abilities, but also  
  >   structure it in a way where we are not making the code non-flexible.  
  >   Christopher Randin, Mark Martene, Ivan Espinosa  

* [Completed] Test like procedure to testing what we have made 20.0 h (20.0 h)

  > This was to import what assets we had and construct the prefabs  
  >	and all necessary scripts to go with them  
  > Encountered problems with configuration between models and  
  > 	scripts to coexist.  
  > One simple error led to a long delay in time causing many scripts   
  >	to fail or not work properly. Solved, which was mesh generated  
  >	colliders conflicting with other collider checking.  
  > Tediously adjusted each unit's collider to fit correctly around the unit  
  > Christopher Randin  

* [Completed/Needs testing] Reconstruction of the GameManager 6.0 h (8.0 h)

  > Added safe clean up for when the GameManager is not needed, works best
  >	with the GM.Instance  
  > Christopher Randin  
  
* [Completed] Creating a simple pooling system 4.0 h (4.0 h)  
  > This allows the usage of reusing objects instead of having to recreate  
  >	and destroy the objects. Currently, this is not in use since we are  
  >	unaware of the amount of units that will be needed and currently, this  
  >	does not expand its cap.  
  > The same references are used so that there is not passing by value.  
  > Tested to assure it works correctly  
  > Christopher Randin  

* [Completed] Made the UnitController expandable to multiple unit 3.0 h (5.0 h)  
  > This allows any unit with the appropriate unit "BaseClass" containing a  
  >	MovementStats script to influences the UnitController to allow the unit  
  >	to move with its own setup status.  
  > Encountered bugs with trying to manipulate each other's values  
  > Also, fixed a bug that would allow the unit to move straight with no input  
  > Christopher Randin  

* [Completed] Fixed the Distance Projector 3.0 h (5.0 h)  
 > This was broken due to UnitController being specific to start up input  
 > Now this behaves more dynamic according to the chosen unit  
 > Change in texture to present more visible  
 > Fixed the artifact of the projector. Continues to scale the radius downward  
 > 	as the unit moves  
 > Christopher Randin  

* [Completed] Separate the Matchmaking into a separate scene 6.0h (12.0h)

> Once a player creates or joins a room, the game is then loaded  
> There were a lot of bugs with the Game Manager and lobby that were solved  
> Some bugs were not solved regarding the game play  
> Mark Martene and Christopher Randin

2014-03-02
==========

Previous Week's Objectives
--------------------------

* [Ongoing] Track animations for our game characters 6.0 h (8.0 h)
  > We met up with our artists to create animations for our game characters.
  > It was our first meeting so it took a while for things to get done.
    - We had to calibrate the software with the two kinects
    - Then we had our actors create animations for each characters
    - Due to the time we were only able to animate three characters
  >  Ivan Espinosa, Christopher Randin, and Mark Martene

* [Ongoing] Created Animations files off of the animations track 16.0 h (8.0 h)
  > We used iPi Mocap Studio 2 to help track animations
  > Due to large computations we had to use Ivan's computer to track the animations
  > We had a prop gun for the sniper, and it created extra data for calibration
    - This made it difficult to track the body of the sniper
  > Our scout animation was fine, but the calibration was off which made the data that we collected off
  > Our Braver animation was completed. All 13 animations
  > We need to recreate most animations. But no longer worried about computation time
  > Ivan Espinosa

* [Incomplete] Complete Fog of War 20.0 h (2.0 h)
  > Allow the rendering of fog focus around players units
  > Have the map revealed where the player's units have already been
        - less dense fog but still visible
  > Had conflicts merging projects, pushed fog of war implementation to a later date
  > Mark Martene and Ivan Espinosa

* [Completed] Fixed issues with DistanceProjection 1.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Issue was incorrect usage of script. Now more easy to use.
   > Readjusted the ratio for display the projection with respect to the unit's
   >    allotted distance.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Made a "better" way to keep track of distance traveled 1.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Calculating distance based on the direction vector taken multiplied against
   >    with the speed. Normalize, take the magnitude, then multiply that by deltatime
   >    which is a method that calculate previous cpu cycle, independent of cpu speed.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Facilitated UnitController as a single entity system 2.0 h (3.0 h)
   > Allows other systems to use it like the GameManager, and provide unit movement to units
   >    based on player action(i.e. Unit Move action)
   > Also fixed other bugs and improve compatibility with GameManager
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed/Can be improved] Updated GameManager some more 3.0 h (5.0 h)
   > Added more facilitating features to allow game flow easier
   > Added set winning conditions and appropriate checks
   > Added check as to when the system should change to next players turn or
   >    or this can be forced by player
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Organized project assets and facilitation 1.0 h (2.0 h)
   > Cleaned up prefabs for the game. Centralized the Game prefab with other requires it needed.
   > Centralized prefab "GenericGame" will contain all necessary functionality that is
   >    required on startup of the game. Easy way of organizing things and instantly creating
   >    maps with basic templates prepared.
   > Improved responsiveness of the GameManager and assets that are being used by the GameManager
   >    Currently, other group member's assets have not been include(should be done eventually)
   > Added Unit_status script, which is a simply enum that gives current condition of the unit,
   >    including leader. Currently, nothing modifies it.
   > It contains the follow:
        - Clean (no actions performed)
        - Clicked (when the unit is being focused by the player)
        - Movement (when the unit is moving)
        - Combat (when the unit is performing some ability)
        - Resting (when the unit can no longer perform any actions)
        - Dead (player dead)
   > Individual prefabs for each unit with appropriate scripts for when we want to add unit specific features
   > Added more error check and warnings for GameManager.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Not Finished] Game Manager transitions/ control unit mechanics created from this week 10.0 h (2.0 h)
   > Was working on transitions when I needed more functionality out of the GameManager and did some improvement
   >    on it as stated above. I should be able to do transitions for this weeks tasks.
   > Previous:
   > Facilitate the game state transitions between players and units a like. Form rules to allow things to be
   >    done only at a certain time.
   > Flow of game, player turn. Allow unit selection for that player. Own player's units can perform actions.
   > When units have more depth into their available actions. Another system will take over and keep track of
   >    available actions that are allowed for a given unit.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Incomplete] Combat System using unit hierarchy 8.0 h (0.0 h)
   > Did not reach this point yet. Unit class system (aka unit hierarchy) is complete, but personally dislike.
   > Could use improvement, but will see if Mark or Ivan have better ideas for implementation.
   > Previous:
   > When unit hierarchy is complete. Integrate facilities for combat.
   > An interface for such methods to communicate as a common object and fight.
   > This is independent of animation. Some parts of the the system may depend on the animation itself,
   >    but we will use some templates. Also, animation time vs delay in damage dealt is a factor as well
   > Christopher Randin

* [Partially Completed] Improve Networking Capabilities 20.0 h (20.0 h)
  > Matchmaking Lobby
    - Implemented Join Random Room Button: This button will connect to any open room, and will create a room if no open rooms are available.
    - Did not implement private rooms with passwords: pushed to upcoming week
    - Did not add a spectator option: pushed to upcoming week
  > In Game
        - Added in character models and attached networking scripts to them: Movement is a lot smoother, animations work correctly
    - Allow chat between players: worked out many bugs that came up with the chat implementation. Players can now send and receive messages to each other, hide the messages by the ESC button, and quickly add new msgs by pressing either Enter buttons.
    - Send and receive RPC signals of each player's character positions: RPC calls made characters movements much smoother, less lag.
    - Send and receive RPC signals of actions: players are aware of each others attack actions
  > In Unity
    - Merge networking code with existing code from other scenes: beginning phase. Merged the Generic scene into the Networking scene. World Camera and main camera will need to be modified to work with networking.
  > Mark Martene

2014-02-23 // Ivan's Birthday
==========
Previous Week's Objectives
---------------------

* [Ongoing] Combine Functionalities for one complete project  6.0 h (4.0 h)
   > We each have individual scenes of the game where we worked on our projects
   > Combine functionality together in terms of our scripts and usage. This is to help generate    more task to complete
   > Help isolate input control and UI interface functionality
   > We need to standardize asset usage, for all of us to use
          (no more creating unnecessary prefabs)
   > Ivan Espinosa, Chris Randin, and Mark Martene

* [Completed] Fix Rotation issues with Camera Pan system  4.0 h (8.0 h)
   > Had to isolate Quaternion rotations when the Camera changed focus on the players units
   > The CameraController would rotate around the y axis, while the camera lens                                                                                                                                                                                                would rotate around the x axis
   > Ivan Espinosa

 * [Completed] Meet up with artist to get work completed 5.0h (6.0 h)
   > Figured out how MoCap works to create animation for the characters of our game
- Since we don't have any animators, we are using MoCap to create base animations of our characters
        - What MoCap does is that it will record our movements with two Microsoft Kinects
                - Then riggers will attach the base human skeleton from maya
                - We have schedule to meet Monday to get our animations done
   > Met up on Thursday with all the artist to create a more refined pipeline
        - Now each artist can look up a file on google drive to see what tasks are                                                                                                                                                                                                needed to complete
                - The tasks are color coded to identify whether in-progress, complete,                                                                                                                                                                                                high priority, etc.
   > Chris Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

* [On-going for future implementations]Test scene for GameManager 3.0 h (3.0 h)

   > Christopher Randin

* [Incomplete] Improve distance travel recording, distance ring constantly updating and following the unit 2 h (0.0 h)
   > Did not have the time to complete the task.
   > Improve the measurement recording
   > Update radius of ring to be dynamic, the unit's new distance movement
   > Christopher Randin

*  [Completed/Can be improved] Use GameManager to help with scene transitions 4.0 h (4.0h)
   > Added leader tracker, to have a pointer to the game object, in which to access components for later use.
   > Testing GameManager, works pretty good so far. Co-exist with current Recruit System.
   > Later implementation, distinguish between which player's leader is whom
   > As we add more functionality, keep tabs with the manager and decide if it is something
   >   it needs to keep track of. Like for when a combat system is necessary, the manager will
   >   see if it is valid to do combat
   > Keep up to date with other functionalities in the game. Optimize manager also improvement to add a better flow to the system.
   > Control the functionalities we have created to let player's do specific actions
   depending on the status of their turn.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed/Can be improved] Implement the recruit system 4.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Instantiate a capsule for now on top of unit. Instantiate is an expensive call. Future implementation will have a pool system to manage unit assets.
   > Assign unit cost on this system.
   > Be within range of "recruitee" object and be able to purchase units
   > Check game restrictions like number of resources meets required pay
   > Have units spawn within a valid vicinity
   > Christopher Randin

* [Ongoing] Start designing Fog of War and implement it 10.0 h (5.0 h)
  > Was able to find implementations of fog of war
        - The fog uses a camera to project the distance that is revealed
        - Ran into trouble with having two cameras
        - If the script is attached to the main camera, it projects the revealed fog from the camera's position and not from the player's position
  > Will need to modify to configure for our game
  > Mark Martene and Ivan Espinosa

* [Partially Completed] Create a multiplayer lobby system 3.0 h (6.0 h)
   > Create and join rooms
        - The player can create a unique name for a room
        - The player can edit the maximum number of players
        - The player can view all existing rooms in a lobby
        - The player can view how many players are currently in the lobby
        - The player can view the maximum number of players in each room
   > Allow players to join locally and get paired with an opponent
        - Still need to have a "Join Random Room" Button
        - Will create private rooms with passwords
   > Allow chat between both parties and maybe a spectator view
        - Still Need to implement the chat and spectator view
   > Mark Martene

This Week's Objectives

  > Allow the rendering of fog focus around players units
  > Have the map revealed where the player's units have already been
        - less dense fog but still visible
  > Mark Martene and Ivan Espinosa

* Game Manager transitions/ control unit mechanics created from this week 10.0 h
   > Facilitate the game state transitions between players and units a like. Form rules to allow things to be done only at a certain time.
   > Flow of game, player turn. Allow unit selection for that player. Own player's units can perform actions.
   > When units have more depth into their available actions. Another system will take over and keep track of available actions that are allowed for a given unit.
   > Christopher Randin

* Combat System using unit hierarchy 8.0 h
   > When unit hierarchy is complete. Integrate facilities for combat.
   > An interface for such methods to communicate as a common object and fight.
   > This is independent of animation. Some parts of the the system may depend on the animation itself, but we will use some templates. Also, animation time vs delay in damage dealt is a factor as well
   > Christopher Randin

* Improve Networking Capabilities 20.0 h
  > Matchmaking Lobby
- Add "Join Random Room" Button
- Add in private rooms with passwords
- Add in a spectator option
  > In Game
        - Add in character models and attach networking scripts to them

==========

Previous Week's Objectives
---------------------

* [Completed/Can be improved] Creating a unit controller 6.0h (4.0 h)
   > Unit control working pretty good. Might need to change the way
   >    it moves, feels rather rigid. Can smooth it for later.
   > Unit has a limited distance as to how far one can travel.
   > Jumping works correctly, just not so fluid. Also, air-jumping is
   >    possible for "special" units.
   > Issue: Keep track of distance is clunky, diagonal movement allows
   >    more distance travel, which shouldn't be.
   > This works independently from the camera, it is assumed the camera
   >    will follow the unit a certain way.
   > Also, includes idle, run, jump animations to be used when assigned
   >    If none are assigned, then it skips it
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Project a circle around a "focus" unit to show how far
        they can move if they walked completely linear. 2.0h (2.0 h)
   > Created a couple of textures to use for the projection
   > This will display onto the ground correctly. This is set to ignore:
   >    "Units", "Leaders" and "Terrain" specific layer maskings.
   > Scaling of projection ortho size took some trial and error to scale
   >    correctly with the distance of 1 unit. Came to be ..
   >    new_ortho_size = unit_distance/(10.0/12.0)
   > This is any easy to use system, simply call "SetProjectorFocus",
   >    from the "DistanceProjection" script passing a "focus"
   >    GameObject, which sets focus internally and project accordingly.
   > Will display error if incorrect object is passed.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed/Ongoing] Communicate with Artists in person 2.0 h (3.0 h)
   > Encourage them for motivation to work on the game
   > Discuss art that will need to get done for the next
   > Ask the main following questions:
        - When is their availability
        - What is the best way to contact them
        - How much time can they put into the game
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene

* [Trashed] Devise a method for creating tile for the map 6.0 h (5.0h)
   > Did not meet the desire for our gameplay and tiles caused too
   >    much restrictions with the desired "feel" for our units.
   > Finalize idea of manual place(static and easy) vs
   >    projection(dynamic and not-so-easy)
   > Implement idea, look up resource for improvement and data
   >    structure design
   > Created appropriate tile placement and find a good ratio for the
   >    tiles to be placed in world space.
