Previous Week's Objectives
--------------------------

* [Ongoing] Track animations for our game characters 6.0 h (8.0 h)
  > We met up with our artists to create animations for our game characters
  > It was our first meeting so it took a while for things to get done.
    - We had to calbirate the software with the two kinects
    - Then we had our actors create animations for each characters
    - Due to the time we were only able to animate three characters
  >  Ivan Espinosa, Christopher Randin, and Mark Martene

* [Ongoing] Created Animations files off of the animations track 16.0 h (8.0 h)
  > We used iPi Mocap Studio 2 to help track animations
  > Due to large computations we had to use Ivan's computer to track the animations
  > We had a prop gun for the sniper, and it created extra data for calibration
    - This made it dificult to track the body of the sniper
  > Our scout animation was fine, but the calibration was off which made the data that we collected off
  > Our Braver animation was completed. All 13 animations
  > We need to recreate most animations. But no longer worried about computation time
  > Ivan Espinosa

* [Completed] Fixed issues with DistanceProjection 1.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Issue was incorrect usage of script. Now more easy to use.
   > Readjusted the ratio for display the projection with respect to the unit's 
   >	allotted distance.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Made a "better" way to keep track of distance traveled 1.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Calculating distance based on the direction vector taken multiplied against 
   >	with the speed. Normalize, take the magnitude, then multiply that by deltatime
   >	which is a method that calculate previous cpu cycle, independent of cpu speed.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Facilitated UnitController as a single entity system 2.0 h (3.0 h)
   > Allows other systems to use it like the GameManager, and provide unit movement to units
   > 	based on player action(i.e. Unit Move action)
   > Also fixed other bugs and improve compatibility with GameManager
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed/Can be improved] Updated GameManager some more 3.0 h (5.0 h)
   > Added more facilitating features to allow game flow easier
   > Added set winning conditions and appropriate checks
   > Added check as to when the system should change to next players turn or
   >	or this can be forced by player
   > Christopher Randin

* [Completed] Organized project assets and facilitation 1.0 h (2.0 h)
   > Cleaned up prefabs for the game. Centralized the Game prefab with other requires it needed.
   > Centralized prefab "Generic_Game" will contain all necessary functionality that is 
   >	required on startup of the game. Easy way of organizing things and instantly creating 
   >	maps with basic templates prepared.
   > Improved responsivness of the GameManager and assets that are being used by the GameManager
   >	Currently, other group member's assets have not been include(should be done eventually)
   > Added Unit_status script, which is a simply enum that gives current condition of the unit, 
   >	including leader. Currently, nothing modifies it. 
   > It contains the follow:
   		- Clean (no actions performed)
		- Clicked (when the unit is being focused by the player)
		- Movement (when the unit is moving)
		- Combat (when the unit is performing some ability)
		- Reseting (when the unit can no longer perform any actions)
		- Dead (player dead)
   > Individual prefabs for each unit with appropriate scripts for when we want to add unit specific features
   > Added more error check and warnings for GameManager.
   > Christopher Randin

* [Not Finished] Game Manager transitions/ control unit mechanics created from this week 10.0 h (2.0 h)
   > Was working on transitions when I needed more functionality out of the GameManager and did some improvement
   >	on it as stated above. I should be able to do transitions for this weeks tasks.
   > Previous:
   > Facilitate the game state transitions between players and units a like. Form rules to allow things to be 
   >	done only at a certain time.
   > Flow of game, player turn. Allow unit selection for that player. Own playerÕs units can perform actions.
   > When units have more depth into their available actions. Another system will take over and keep track of
   >	available actions that are allowed for a given unit.
   > Christopher Randin


* [Incomplete] Combat System using unit hierarchy 8.0 h (0.0 h)
   > Did not reach this point yet. Unit class system (aka unit hierarchy) is complete, but personally dislike.
   > Could use improvement, but will see if Mark or Ivan have better ideas for implementation.
   > Previous:
   > When unit hierarchy is complete. Integrate facilities for combat.
   > An interface for such methods to communicate as a common object and fight.
   > This is independent of animation. Some parts of the the system may depend on the animation itself, 
   >	but we will use some templates. Also, animation time vs delay in damage dealt is a factor as well
   > Christopher Randin




* Improve Networking Capabilities 20.0 h (20.0 h)
  > Matchmaking Lobby
	- Implemented ÒJoin Random RoomÓ Button: This button will connect to any open room, and will create a room if no open rooms are available.
	- Did not implement private rooms with passwords: pushed to upcoming week
	- Did not add a spectator option: pushed to upcoming week
  > In Game
        - Added in character models and attached networking scripts to them: Movement is a lot smoother, animations work correctly
	- Allow chat between players: worked out many bugs that came up with the chat implementation. PlayerÕs can now send and receive messages to each other, hide the messages by the ESC button, and quickly add new msgs by pressing either Enter buttons.
	- Send and receive RPC signals of each playerÕs character positions: RPC calls made characters movements much smoother, less lag.
	- Send and receive RPC signals of actions: playerÕs are aware of each otherÕs attack actions
  > In Unity
	- Merge networking code with existing code from other scenes: beginning phase. Merged the Generic scene into the Networking scene. World Camera and main camera will need to be modified to work with networking.
  > Mark Martene


This Week's Objectives
---------------------
* Continue animation for our charcter models 7.0 h
   > We will redo all of the animations that was not captured
   > We will also attempt to do the arcane animation
   > This time instead of using a gun prop we will try to use a wireframe gun-model
   > Ivan Espinosa, Mark Martene, and Chris Randin

* Track Animation with iPi Mocap software 8.0 h 
   > This will requires Ivan's computer
   > Hopefully there is no issues tracking the animations
   > Ivan Espinosa

==========

Previous Week's Objectives
---------------------


* [Ongoing] Combine Functionalities for one complete project  6.0 h (4.0 h)
   > We each have individual scenes of the game where we worked on our projects
   > Combine functionality together in terms of our scripts and usage. 
   >	This is to help generate    more task to complete
   > Help isolate input control and UI interface functionality
   > We need to standardize asset usage, for all of us to use
   >	(no more creating unnecessary prefabs)
   > Ivan Espinosa, Chris Randin, and Mark Martene


* [Completed] Fix Rotation issues with Camera Pan system  4.0 h (8.0 h)
   > Had to isolate Quaternion rotations when the Camera changed focus on the 
   >	players units
   > The CameraController would rotate around the y axis, while the camera 
   >	lens would rotate around the x axis
   > Ivan Espinosa


 * [Completed] Meet up with artist to get work completed 5.0h (6.0 h)
   > Figured out how MoCap works to create animation for the characters of our game
	- Since we dont have any animators, we are using MoCap to create base 
		animations of our characters
        - What MoCap does is that it will record our movements with two Microsoft Kinects
        - Then riggers will attach the base human skeleton from maya
        - We have schedule to meet Monday to get our animations done
   > Met up on Thursday with all the artist to create a more refined pipeline
        - Now each artist can look up a file on google drive to see what tasks 
		are needed to complete
        - The tasks are color coded to identify whether in-progress, complete,	
		high priority, etc.
   > Chris Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* [On-going for future implementations]Test scene for GameManager 3.0 h (3.0 h)
   > This is an environment to test the GameManager
   > Fixed issues when improved scripts else where
   > Updated GUI view to delegates, while familiarizing myself with them
   > Christopher Randin


* [Incomplete] Improve distance travel recording, distance ring constantly 
	updating and following the unit 2 h (0.0 h)
   > Did not have the time to complete the task.
   > Improve the measurement recording 
   > Update radius of ring to be dynamic, the unitÕs new distance movement
   > Christopher Randin


*  [Completed/Can be improved] Use GameManager to help with scene transitions 4.0 h (4.0h)
   > Added leader tracker, to have a pointer to the game object, in which to 
   >	access components for later use.
   > Testing GameManager, works pretty good so far. Co-exist with current Recruit System.
   > Later implementation, distinguish between which playerÕs leader is whom
   > As we add more functionality, keep tabs with the manager and decide if it is something
   >   it needs to keep track of. Like for when a combat system is necessary, the manager will
   >   see if it is valid to do combat
   > Keep up to date with other functionalities in the game. Optimize manager also 
   >	improvement to add a better flow to the system.
   > Control the functionalities we have created to let playerÕs do specific actions
   depending on the status of their turn.
   > Christopher Randin


* [Completed/Can be improved] Implement the recruit system 4.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Instantiate a capsule for now on top of unit. Instantiate is an expensive call. 
   >	Future implementation will have a pool system to manage unit assets.
   > Assign unit cost on this system.
   > Be within range of ÒrecruiteeÓ object and be able to purchase units
   > Check game restrictions like number of resources meets required pay
   > Have units spawn within a valid vicinity 
   > Christopher Randin


* [Ongoing] Start designing Fog of War and implement it 10.0 h (5.0 h)
  > Was able to find implementations of fog of war
        - The fog uses a camera to project the distance that is revealed
        - Ran into trouble with having two cameras
        - If the script is attached to the main camera, it projects the 
		revealed fog from the cameraÕs position and not from the player's position
  > Will need to modify to configure for our game
  > Mark Martene and Ivan Espinosa


* [Partially Completed] Create a multiplayer lobby system 3.0 h (6.0 h)
   > Create and join rooms
        - The player can create a unique name for a room
        - The player can edit the maximum number of players
        - The player can view all existing rooms in a lobby
        - The player can view how many players are currently in the lobby
        - The player can view the maximum number of players in each room
   > Allow players to join locally and get paired with an opponent
        - Still need to have a ÒJoin Random RoomÓ Button
        - Will create private rooms with passwords
   > Allow chat between both parties and maybe a spectator view
        - Still Need to implement the chat and spectator view
   > Mark Martene

  > Until this is is completed, we can then construct the combat system
  > Ivan Espinosa


* Complete Fog of War 20.0 h 
  > Allow the rendering of fog focus around players units 
  > Have the map revealed where the playerÕs units have already been
        - less dense fog but still visible
  > Mark Martene and Ivan Espinosa


* Game Manager transitions/ control unit mechanics created from this week 10.0 h
   > Facilitate the game state transitions between players and units a like. Form rules to allow things to be done only at a certain time.

Previous Week's Objectives
---------------------


* [Completed/Can be improved] Creating a unit controller 6.0h (4.0 h)
   > Unit control working pretty good. Might need to change the way 
   >        it moves, feels rather rigid. Can smooth it for later.
   > Unit has a limited distance as to how far one can travel.
   > Jumping works correctly, just not so fluid. Also, air-jumping is
   >        possible for "special" units.
   > Issue: Keep track of distance is clunky, diagonal movement allows
   >        more distance travel, which shouldn't be.
   > This works independently from the camera, it is assumed the camera
   >        will follow the unit a certain way.
   > Also, includes idle, run, jump animations to be used when assigned
   >        If none are assigned, then it skips it
   > Christopher Randin


* [Completed] Project a circle around a "focus" unit to show how far
         they can move if they walked completely linear. 2.0h (2.0 h)
   > Created a couple of textures to use for the projection 
   > This will display onto the ground correctly. This is set to ignore:
   >        "Units", "Leaders" and "Terrain" specific layer maskings.
   > Scaling of projection ortho size took some trial and error to scale 
   >        correctly with the distance of 1 unit. Came to be ..
   >        new_ortho_size = unit_distance/(10.0/12.0)
   > This is any easy to use system, simply call "SetProjectorFocus", 
   >        from the "DistanceProjection" script passing a "focus" 
   >        GameObject, which sets focus internally and project accordingly.
   > Will display error if incorrect object is passed.
   > Christopher Randin


* [Completed/Ongoing] Communicate with Artists in person 2.0 h (3.0 h)
   > Encourage them for motivation to work on the game
   > Discuss art that will need to get done for the next
   > Ask the main following questions:
        - When is their availability
        - What is the best way to contact them
        - How much time can they put into the game
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* [Completed] Come Up with Additional Race 2.0 h (2.0 h)
   > Find the opposing race of our human race

   > Mark Martene


* [Completed] Comb through a simulated round of the game to come up with questions about the game design 2.5h (5.0h)
  > Discovered problem with tiles and attacking
  > Finalized minor details of the gameplay
  > Discussed UI elements and placement
  > Discussed input devices
  > Discussed what specifically happens/can happen during a turn
  > Mark Martene


* [Not Completed]Construct an easy to use camera pane system 4.0 h (1.0 h)
   > Be able to move the camera when moving cursor to edge of the screen thus moving the camera, in their respectful direction.
   > Allow, mouse to focus on ÔvalidÕ units, thus lock the camera towards that unit and reach only to its valid movement spaces.
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* [Trashed] Devise a method for creating tile for the map 6.0 h (5.0h)
   > Did not meet the desire for our gameplay and tiles caused too 
   >        much restrictions with the desired "feel" for our units.
   > Finalize idea of manual place(static and easy) vs 
   >        projection(dynamic and not-so-easy)
   > Implement idea, look up resource for improvement and data 
   >        structure design
   > Created appropriate tile placement and find a good ratio for the 
   >        tiles to be placed in world space.
   > Ignore objects with tag "Obstruction" to avoid placing a valid 
   >        tile on the map.
   > Christopher Randin and Ivan Espinosa

   >        - Movement (toggle UnitController)
   >        - Attack (toggle combat system, which introduces damage to a source)
   >        - Spells (toggle combat system or environment interaction system, which does damage or spells affect the environment in someway
   >         - Wait (essentially a unit exhaust)
   >         -  And other possible available actions
   > Christopher Randin


* Construct a working UI interface 5.0 h
   > Have static Òalways visibleÓ info on the screen
   > Have the action interface pop up when a character is selected
   > Have the character simulate an attack when the attack button is clicked - values changed not animated
   > Have the character defend when the defend button is clicked
   > Have a temporary message Òability usedÓ print to the console when the ability button is clicked
   > Shadow out character  when ÒwaitÓ or ÒholdÓ is clicked
   > Have ÒFinish TurnÓ to have the game manager change playerÕs turn
   > Have the UI communicate with the game manager system

Previous WeekÕs Objectives
---------------------


* [Completed] Reaching out to individuals interested in our game 3.5 d (7.0 h)
   > Explained expectation for game, type of style we desired
   > Artist that are interested to work with us
        - Daniel Root - Character Concept Art / Character Modeler 
        - Kevin Barrientos - Character Modeler
        - Kelly Mai - Environmental / Character Concept Artist
        - Lily Russell - Character Concept Art
        - Melody Palisoc - Prop and Character Model
        - Emily Chiang - Rigger / Animator
        - Brian Crawford - Rigger
        - Jeremy Moyer - Game Design
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* [Ongoing] Go over Unity Tutorials by the end of the week 2.0 h (5.0 h)
   > Understand how to work with the Interface
   > Go over scripting language for Unity and understand the functionality
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* [Completed] Setting up repo and SSH 1.0 h (3.0 h)
   > Setting up a common repo for us all to work from. Currently, we have chosen to work under Òusrname@delaunay.ecs.fullerton.edu/var/git/crandin/Ember_Quest.gitÓ
   > SSH established for all of us.
   > Read the first 3 chapters of the GitPro book
   > Christopher Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* [Complete/Can be improved]Add Unity source code 1.0 h (0.5 h)
   > Push a Unity Project into git
   > Add .gitignore file to the rep for space efficiency
   > Christopher Randin


* [Completed] Finalized theme, game objectives, structure and discuss creative gameplay 5.0 h (8.0h)
   > Discussion as to what we desired from a fantasy world. Not wanting to focusing on the same fantasy style (i.e. Orcs v Human) Synopsis of the world is that it is dying and different groups of people are fighting over resources to survive this per-apocalyptic world.
   > Acquired a desired game mode, i.e. versus, with multiple ways of winning.
        - Acquire an X amount of ÔresourcesÕ
        - Kill opponentÕs leader
        - Capture and hold X number of resource points for a Y amount of turns
   > Discussed the current groups priorities for this game
        - Submission as a final project


* Submission for this years, 2014, GameSig competition 
   > Discussed likes and dislike from other games. Presenting ideas we would like to incorporate into our game to give it uniqueness and bringing in fun mechanics from other games and/or modify with our own twist.
   > Artist presented concept art for the units we desired of the 6 units(Braver, Scout, Vanguard, Arcane, Titan, Sniper). Went over discussion on what their roles were as individuals.
   > Discussed what we wanted in the game for demo purposes:
        - 2 races
        - Unique mechanics to go with each race, choose leaders
        - Simple story/theme
        - Game mode: Versus
        - 1 Map(maybe 2 depending on time)
        - Dynamic environment with each unit(grappel to trees, break trees/wall)
   > Christopher Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* [Ongoing] Setting up the start-up requirements and small features 2.0h (2.0h)
   > Waiting for more info as to how the game was going to play out
   > Though about possible improvement over square tile, idealize over tile projection(automatically constructs visual aspect of tile depending on the construction of the environment) vs. tile placement(easier, but a lot of manual work to reposition if map changes)
   > Construct basis class for hierarchical structure of unit derivation.
   > Christopher Randin and Ivan Espinosa


This Week's Objectives
-------------------


* Communicate with Artists in person 2.0 h
   > Encourage them for motivation to work on the game
   > Discuss art that will need to get done for the next
   > Ask the main following questions:
        - When is their availability
        - What is the best way to contact them
        - How much time can they put into the game
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* Come Up with Additional Race 2.0 h
   > Find the opposing race of our human race
   > Have concept artists start to work on additional race
   > Chris Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* Devise a method for creating tile for the map 6.0 h
   > Finalize idea of manual place(static and easy) vs projection(dynamic and not-so-easy)
   > Implement idea, look up resource for improvement and data structure design
   > Christopher Randin and Ivan Espinosa


* Document what intractable objects will be in the environment 3.0 h
   > Write-up report as to how to make the world dynamic
   > No programming expected, till units are finalize in concept and code
   > Christopher Randin, Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene


* Construct class hierarchy 2.0 h
   > Create base class to inherit from, also provide virtual future to unify objects 
   > Create basic class for each unit, think of individual traits for each unit
   > Mark Martene


* Construct an easy to use camera pane system 4.0 h
   > Be able to move the camera when moving cursor to edge of the screen thus moving the camera, in their respectful direction.
   > Allow, mouse to focus on valid units, thus lock the camera towards that unit and reach only to its valid movement spaces.
   > Ivan Espinosa and Mark Martene
